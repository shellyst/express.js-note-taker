## About

This application gives a user the ability to write and save notes so that they can keep track of their thoughts and track tasks they need to complete.

When a user opens the application, they are presented with a landing page that links to a notes page, and when a user clicks the link to the notes page, the user then is presented with a page with existing notes in the left field.

When new notes are entered, a save icon appears at the top of the page's navigation, and the new note can then be saved and added to the left-hand column. Existing notes can be viewed when each note is clicked, and users can delete notes using the trashcan icon beside each note.

This application connects an Express.js back-end to a pre-written front-end codebase, and uses POST, GET, and DELETE routes in order to provide the functionality for the application.
